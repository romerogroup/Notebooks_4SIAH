Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum continued as Python's lead developer until July 12, 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's **Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)**, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.

    "### Key characteristics of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **clean and simple language:** (KISS principle) Easy-to-read and intuitive code, minimalist syntax, scales well with projects.\n",
    "* **expressive language:** Fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",
    "* **multiparadigm:** Including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming or procedural styles. \n",
    "* **standard library:** Large and comprehensive set of functions that runs consistently where Python runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **dynamically typed:** No need to define the type of variables, function arguments, or return types.\n",
    "* **automatic memory management:** No need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays (Like _malloc_ in C). \n",
    "* **interpreted:** No need to compile the code. The Python interpreter reads and executes the python code directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main advantage is the ease of programming, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code.\n",
    "* Well designed language that encourages many good programming practices:\n",
    "* Modular and object-oriented programming, a good system for packaging and re-use of code. This often results in more transparent, maintainable, and bug-free code.\n",
    "* Documentation tightly integrated with the code (Documentation is usually accessed by different means and depending on the interface used, such as scripting, notebooks, etc).\n",
    "* A large standard library, and a large collection of add-on packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since Python is an interpreted and dynamically typed programming language, the execution of python code can be slow compared to compiled statically typed programming languages, such as C and Fortran. \n",
    "* Lacks a standard GUI, there are several.\n",
    "* The current version of Python is 3.10.5 (July 2022). Since January 1, 2020, the older Python 2.x is no longer maintained. You should only use Python 3.x for all scientific purposes.\n"

    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as **attributes** or **properties**), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as **methods**). A feature of objects is an object's procedure that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \" self\"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Object-oriented programming is more than just classes and objects; it's a whole programming paradigm based around [sic] objects (data structures) that contain data fields and methods. It is essential to understand this; using classes to organize a bunch of unrelated methods together is not object orientation.\n",

    "Class is a central concept in OOP. Classes provide means of bundling data and functionality together. Instances of a class are called objects. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for defining classes in Python is shown with some plain examples. Anything indented in the class is within the scope of the class. Usually, they are named such that the first letter is capitalized. Variables can be defined within the class but you can also initialize some variables by calling, *__init__*, which sets the values for any parameters that need to be defined when an object is first created. You define the methods within the class but to have access to that method, you need to include *self* in the method signature. Now, to use, you just call the class, which then will create all variables within the class. If the class is created with some parameter, it will pass directly the variable that has been instantiated in *init*. "

    "Our objective is to create a Python Class that could deal with Quaternions as simple and direct as possible. A class is a concept from Object-Oriented programming that allows to abstract the idea of an object. An object is something that has properties and can do things. In our case, we will create a _class_ Quaternion. Instances of the class will be specific quaternions. We can do things with quaternions such as _add_ two quaternions and multiply them using the multiplication rule above, we can do pretty much the same kind of things that we can expect from complex numbers but in a rather more elaborated way. Let us create a first our first version of the class Quaternion and we will improve it later on.\n"
